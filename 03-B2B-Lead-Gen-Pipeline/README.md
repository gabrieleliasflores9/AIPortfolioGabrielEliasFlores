# 🔍 Automated B2B Lead Generation Pipeline

## 📄 Overview
A data extraction system designed to build targeted lead lists automatically. It scrapes public business directories, validates contact information, and organizes data into a structured CRM (Google Sheets) ready for outreach.

## 🎯 The Problem
Manual prospecting is slow and error-prone. Copy-pasting details from Google Maps or LinkedIn into a spreadsheet limits a sales team to ~50 leads per day.

## 💡 The Solution
I built a scraper pipeline that:
1.  **Extracts Data:** Pulls target companies based on niche and location (e.g., "Dental Clinics in Miami") via Apify.
2.  **Cleans & Formats:** Standardizes phone numbers and names.
3.  **Delivers:** Populates a Google Sheet automatically, enabling the sales team to focus purely on closing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Apify** (Extraction logic)
* **Google Sheets** (Database / CRM)
* **n8n / Make** (Data routing)

## 📊 Results
* **Volume:** Capable of processing 1,000+ leads per hour.
* **Accuracy:** Eliminates copy-paste errors completely.
* **Impact:** Reduced list-building time by 100%.
